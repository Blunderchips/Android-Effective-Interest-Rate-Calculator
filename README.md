# Effective Interest Rate Calculator Android App
### A simple app designed to do just that.

This app is designed to calculate effective interest rates and nothing else. It is hopefully the first in a series of apps I intend to make with each app performing a single mathematical task. The idea is that a user downloads the app, performs the calculation they wish to perform and then uninstall the app. The free version contains ads.
